# Terms and Conditions

**Last Updated: January 23, 2026**

Welcome to Navve! These terms are designed to be clear and fair. By using Navve, you agree to these terms. If you have questions, contact us at admin@wimsightlabs.com

## 1. What Navve Does

Navve helps you save, organize, and find places you care about. You can add places from Apple maps app links, addresses, or manual entry. The app works on your device, and if you're signed in to iCloud, your data is automatically backed up (you can disable this in your device settings if you prefer).

---

## 2. Subscription Plans

Navve offers two plans:

- **Free Plan**: Save up to 10 places with iCloud backup across your devices
- **Pro Plan**: Unlimited places with iCloud sync across all your devices
- **Subscriptions are managed through Apple's App Store**
- **You can cancel anytime through your App Store settings**

---

## 3. Your Data & Privacy

Your privacy matters to us:

- **Free Plan**: Up to 10 places backed up to iCloud across your devices
- **Pro Plan**: Unlimited places synced via Apple's iCloud (subject to Apple's terms)
- **Private & Secure**: Your places and collections are stored in your personal iCloud account. We (the developer) do not have access to your data
- **We don't track your location or sell your data**
- **You own your data and can export it anytime**
- **Your data is used only to provide the Navve service on your device**

---

## 4. Acceptable Use

Please use Navve responsibly. Don't:

- Use the app for anything illegal
- Try to hack or break the app
- Share or redistribute the app's code
- Use the app in ways that harm others or the service

*Basically: use Navve to save and organize places, and be respectful.*

---

## 5. Location Data & Third-Party Services

Navve uses location data to show you where places are on a map and to provide directions. We use Apple's services (Maps, iCloud, Geocoding) to make the app work. When you use features like "Get Directions," you'll be using Apple Maps, Google Maps, or Waze according to your choice, and their terms apply.

---

## 6. No Warranties - Use at Your Own Risk

We work hard to make Navve reliable, but we can't guarantee it will always work perfectly. The app is provided "as is" without any warranties. We're not responsible if:

- The app has bugs or doesn't work as expected
- You lose data (though we do our best to prevent this)
- Third-party services (like Apple Maps) don't work
- Addresses or coordinates are incorrect
- You can't access your places temporarily

*Always double-check important information, especially addresses and coordinates.*

---

## 7. Our Liability is Limited

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we're not liable for any damages arising from your use of Navve. This includes:

- Lost data or places
- Incorrect addresses or directions
- Time or money lost from using the app
- Problems caused by third-party services
- Any indirect or consequential damages

---

## 8. Cancellation & Account Termination

You can stop using Navve anytime. Cancel your subscription through the App Store if you have a Pro plan. We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms, but we'll try to give you notice if possible.

---

## 9. Changes to These Terms

We may update these terms occasionally. When we do, we'll update the "Last Updated" date. For major changes, we'll try to notify you through the app. By continuing to use Navve after changes, you agree to the new terms.
