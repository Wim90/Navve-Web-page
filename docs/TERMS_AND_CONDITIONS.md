# Terms and Conditions

**Last Updated: February 20, 2026**

Welcome to Navve! These terms are designed to be clear and fair. By using Navve, you agree to these terms. If you have questions, contact us at admin@wimsightlabs.com

---

## 1. What Navve Does

Navve helps you save, organize, and share the places that matter to you. Add places your way: share directly from Apple Maps, paste an Apple Maps link, drop in any address, or enter details manually. The app works on your device, and if you're signed in to iCloud, your data is automatically backed up (you can disable this in your device settings if you prefer).

---

## 2. Subscription Plans

Navve offers two plans:

- **Free Plan**: Save up to 10 places with iCloud backup across your devices
- **Pro Plan**: Unlimited places with iCloud sync across all your devices
- **Subscriptions are managed through Apple's App Store**
- **You can cancel anytime through your App Store settings**

---

## 3. Your Data & Privacy

We take your privacy seriously. We don't have access to your places or collections, we don't track you, and we don't sell your data. How your data is stored (including the fact that iCloud is optional and what happens if you don't use it) is described in full in our **Privacy Policy**.

**We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy** (available in the app under Settings and on our website) so you understand how Navve handles your data and what choices you have.

---

## 4. Acceptable Use

Please use Navve responsibly. Don't:

- Use the app for anything illegal
- Try to hack or break the app
- Share or redistribute the app's code
- Use the app in ways that harm others or the service

*Basically: use Navve to save and organize places, and be respectful.*

---

## 5. Location Data & Third-Party Services

Navve uses location data to show you where places are on a map and to provide directions. We use Apple's services (Maps, iCloud, Geocoding) to make the app work. When you use features like "Get Directions," you'll be using Apple Maps, Google Maps, or Waze according to your choice, and their terms apply.

---

## 6. No Warranties - Use at Your Own Risk

We work hard to make Navve reliable, but we can't guarantee it will always work perfectly. The app is provided "as is" without any warranties. We're not responsible if:

- The app has bugs or doesn't work as expected
- You lose data (though we do our best to prevent this)
- Third-party services (like Apple Maps) don't work
- Addresses or coordinates are incorrect
- You can't access your places temporarily

*Always double-check important information, especially addresses.*

---

## 7. Our Liability is Limited

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we're not liable for any damages arising from your use of Navve. This includes:

- Lost data or places
- Incorrect addresses or directions
- Time or money lost from using the app
- Problems caused by third-party services
- Any indirect or consequential damages


---

## 8. Stopping Use & Cancelling Your Subscription

You can stop using Navve anytime—there is no account with us to close. If you have a Pro plan, cancel your subscription through your App Store subscription settings; that will stop future charges. Your data remains subject to the Privacy Policy (e.g. in your iCloud or on your device until you delete the app).

---

## 9. Changes to These Terms

We may update these terms occasionally. When we do, we'll update the "Last Updated" date. For major changes, we'll try to notify you through the app. By continuing to use Navve after changes, you agree to the new terms.
