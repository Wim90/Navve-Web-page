# Navve Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 23, 2026**

Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how Navve handles your data. The short version: we don't collect, sell, or share your personal information.

---

## 1. What We Don't Collect

Navve is designed with privacy in mind. We don't collect:

- Your personal information (name, email, phone number)
- Your location or movement patterns
- Analytics or usage data
- Device identifiers or tracking data
- Any information about the places you save

**We simply don't have access to your data. Period.**

---

## 2. Where Your Data Lives

All your places are stored in your personal iCloud account:

- **Free Plan**: Up to 10 places backed up to your iCloud
- **Pro Plan**: Unlimited places synced via your iCloud
- Your data never touches our servers
- Only you can access your places through your Apple ID
- Your data is encrypted by Apple's iCloud

*Think of it this way: your places are stored in your iCloud, just like your photos or notes. We never see them.*

---

## 3. Apple Services We Use

Navve uses Apple's services to function properly:

- **iCloud**: Backs up and syncs your places across your devices
- **MapKit**: Shows places on a map and provides geocoding
- **CoreLocation**: Gets your location (only when you use map features)
- **StoreKit**: Manages subscriptions through the App Store

These services are governed by Apple's Privacy Policy. We don't receive any data from these services.

---

## 4. Location Permissions

Navve may request location access for these features:

- Showing your current location on the map
- Sorting places by distance from you
- Centering the map on your location

*Your location is processed on your device only. We never receive, store, or track your location.*

---

## 5. Third-Party Services

When you use certain features, you may interact with third-party services:

- Apple Maps, Google Maps, or Waze (when getting directions)
- Your email app (when contacting support)
- Sharing apps (when sharing places with friends)

These services have their own privacy policies. We don't control or receive data from them.

---

## 6. Your Data, Your Control

You have complete control over your data:

- Export all your places anytime (Settings → Export Places)
- Delete individual places or all places
- Disable iCloud sync in your device settings
- Delete the app to remove all local data

*Since your data is in your iCloud, deleting the app doesn't delete your iCloud data. Manage iCloud data in your device Settings → Apple ID → iCloud.*

---

## 7. Children's Privacy

Navve doesn't collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13. The app is safe for all ages.

---

## 8. Data Security

Your data security is provided by Apple's iCloud:

- Data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Only accessible with your Apple ID credentials
- Protected by Apple's security infrastructure
- Two-factor authentication recommended

---

## 9. Changes to This Policy

If we update this privacy policy, we'll change the "Last Updated" date. We'll notify you of significant changes through the app. Our commitment to not collecting your data won't change.
