# Navve Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 20, 2026**

Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how Navve handles your data. The short version: we don't collect, sell, or share your personal information.

---

## 1. What We Don't Collect

Navve is designed with privacy in mind. We don't collect:

- Your personal information (name, email, phone number)
- Your location or movement patterns
- Analytics or usage data
- Device identifiers or tracking data
- Any information about the places you save

**We simply don't have access to your data. Period.**

---

## 2. Where Your Data Lives

**You choose whether to use iCloud.**

**If you use iCloud** (signed in with your Apple ID and iCloud enabled for Navve):

- **Free Plan**: Up to 10 places backed up to your iCloud
- **Pro Plan**: Unlimited places synced via your iCloud
- Your data never touches our servers
- Only you can access your places through your Apple ID
- Your data is encrypted by Apple's iCloud

*Think of it this way: your places are stored on your device and in your iCloud, just like your photos or notes. We never see them.*

**If you do not use iCloud** (you are signed out of iCloud or have disabled iCloud for Navve in your device settings):

- All your places and collections are stored **only on your device**
- Nothing is synced to the cloud; we have no copy of your data
- **Deleting the app will delete all of this data permanently.** It cannot be recovered or retrieved

---

## 3. Apple Services We Use

Navve uses Apple's services to function properly:

- **iCloud** (optional): If you use it, iCloud backs up and syncs your places across your devices. You can turn this off in your device settings (Settings → Apple ID → iCloud → Navve); in that case, data stays only on the device (see Section 2).
- **MapKit**: Shows places on a map and provides geocoding
- **CoreLocation**: Gets your location (only when you use map features)
- **StoreKit**: Manages subscriptions through the App Store

These services are governed by Apple's Privacy Policy. We don't receive any data from these services.

---

## 4. Location Permissions

Navve may request location access for these features:

- Showing your current location on the map
- Sorting places by distance from you
- Centering the map on your location

*Your location is processed on your device only. We never receive, store, or track your location.*

---

## 5. Third-Party Services

When you use certain features, you may interact with third-party services:

- Apple Maps, Google Maps, or Waze (when getting directions)
- Your email app (when contacting support)
- Sharing apps (when sharing places with friends)

These services have their own privacy policies. We don't control or receive data from them.

---

## 6. Your Data, Your Control

You have complete control over your data:

- Export all your places anytime (Settings → Export Places)
- Delete individual places or all places
- **Choose whether to use iCloud**: Disable iCloud for Navve in your device settings (Settings → Apple ID → iCloud) if you prefer to keep data only on your device
- Delete the app to remove all local data

**If you use iCloud:** Deleting the app does not delete your data from iCloud. You can manage or delete that data in Settings → Apple ID → iCloud.

**If you do not use iCloud:** All data is only on your device. Deleting the app deletes that data permanently and it cannot be retrieved. Export your places first if you want to keep a copy.

---

## 7. Children's Privacy

Navve doesn't collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13. The app is safe for all ages.

---

## 8. Data Security

**When you use iCloud:** Your data is protected by Apple's iCloud (encrypted in transit and at rest, accessible only with your Apple ID; two-factor authentication is recommended).

**When you don't use iCloud:** Your data stays on your device and is protected by your device's security (e.g. passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID). We never receive or store it.

---

## 9. Changes to This Policy

If we update this privacy policy, we'll change the "Last Updated" date. We'll notify you of significant changes through the app. Our commitment to not collecting your data won't change.

## The Bottom Line

**Navve is built with privacy as a core principle. We don't collect, store, analyze, or sell your data. You can use iCloud to sync your places across devices, or keep everything only on your device—your choice. We never see what you save or where you go. Your privacy is protected by design.**
